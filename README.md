# The purpose of this project was to use RK4, interpolation, numerical solution of ODEs, and Least squares analysis to approximate how three different viruses, COVID-19, measles, and Seasonal Influenza, affect a small, sampled population of 1000 people. By dividing the popuulation into those who are susceptible, have been infected, and who have recovered, and using beta and gamma to represent the transmission rate and recovery rate, respectively, we are able to plot a graph to visualize and simulate the progression of these three diseases over a period of 100 days.
